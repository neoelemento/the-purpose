**Drass Sub-sector, Kargil**
*Mid – July 1999*

An eerie silence followed for the first time in days after the heavy round of firing. Another burst of fire continued, just to make sure they are all really dead. Capt. Vishwa lead his troop of twelve battle hardened men swiftly through the treacherous terrain of unpredictably icy path to get through to the point of assembly. All the while under heavy artillery fire by the enemy.

He gestured with his hand to Lt. Balveer Singh and four others to pass through the fifteen feet long ridge, to take cover in the trenches leading to the boulder behind which the enemies are taking cover. He shook his head in agreement and waited with the rest to for the right moment. The suppressive fire would give them just about five seconds to cover the distance. They lunged into action as Captain and the rest emptied a magazine right at the boulder. Lieutenant and his men ascended rapidly and jumped into a trench, taking position to provide cover for the rest. They were surprised to find no resistance to the firing and waited for a few moments before the rest moved.

The covering fire continued and another four soldiers made it through. It was time for Captain and the rest of the two men to make a move for the trenches. Everything turned to slow motion as the suppressive fire began, again. He held his breath and ran for the trenches. Halfway through, he could hear another set of gunfire which made him realise that the enemies have finally responded. He jumped into the trenches and waited for the other two to follow, but they did not. He stole a glance over the trench to realise his team turned from twelve to ten. All of a sudden he felt the excruciating pain shoot through his abdomen and his blood boiling. Unlike what he expected it to be, he kept himself in check than panic.

Instead of attending the wound or checking on the men left behind, in a surge of adrenaline, he lead his troop and invaded the boulder with ease. Their valiant effort paid dividend; the mission completed and the Drass Sub-sector taken back. Capt. Vishwa felt proud of his team and himself as the pain and loss of blood got to him. He fell to the ground as the rest finally noticed their Captain is wounded and came to his aid. Lt. Balveer knelt and supported the Captain’s head over his hand.

“It's over. The war is almost over. Win it for me Lieutenant,” He said as he breathed his last holding Lt. Balveer’s hand, “Win it for me.”
