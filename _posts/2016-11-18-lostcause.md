Tony’s hand shivered working his way on the stick. He put it on first and slammed on the throttle. The 169 horsepower came to life again and roared forward. He narrowly avoided the car in front but took off its rear view mirror. He could hear the passengers scream in agony, trying to start their cars as the SUV flew past them. The image of four men pointing guns at them was something he never expected to go through during this trip. Yet, here he is. One of the terrorists emptied a magazine on the Toyota shattering the rear windshield. They crashed through the check post and continued racing north at speeds no vehicles ever dared to go on that road.

“Is everyone okay.” Shouted Shiva, concerned.

Everyone responded positively except Stella.

“I think I got shot.” She said trying to stop the blood flowing from her chest.

“Oh my god!” Said an alarmed Sheetal examining her.

“Stella what happened? What happened?” Yelled Tony as Shiva looked on shocked.

“We have to get off the road,” Cried Sheetal, “I think we should take the next U-turn in about 700 metres.”

“What you mean take a U-turn? We have to go to a fucking hospital.” He said enraged.

“Listen to me Tony,” Sheetal leant forward to explain, “there is no chance of use reaching a hospital alive if the whole place is surrounded by militants.” She grabs a bedspread from one of the bags from behind and uses it to try and stop the bleeding as Stella appears to go into a shock.

“I found a school there while checking on the map. They might have first aid.” She screams over the sounds of the engine and the machine gun fire going on in close proximity. “It is our only chance.”

Sheetal knew Stella would not survive if she continues to lose blood at this rate. She curses herself for not being prepared with a first aid. Being a doctor herself, this is unacceptable. *But I never expected it to go out of hand like this.*

No one tried to question her. “Okay…”

*Stella is shot. She needs help.* Tony’s mind cluttered with 'what ifs', but he tried his best to shut it all out and focus on the mission at hand. He could faintly see the U-turn approaching and he prepared himself to make the high speed turn.

“Hang on!” He said making a sharp turn to the right. Halfway through he realised he came in too fast. He slammed on the brake and turned the steering with all the strength he had. The car does a wheelie on the left wheels and skims out of the road onto the gravel. He prays for the car not to overturn. Then the right wheels touch the ground and they let out a huge sigh of relief. *Back in control.*

“That was close.” Shiva breathes for the first time since they rammed through the check post. Sheetal by now is checking on her phone with one hand and helping Stella with the other. “The school is about 500 metres in front. We will get help there”she said as Stella is at the brink of losing consciousness. Stella knew she did not have much time. She made peace with it and closed her eyes. *Serenity.*

The road curved to the right and they saw a board to the side of the road. The headlights of the car illuminated a board and read - Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya (250 metres).  As they went past, their gaze moved to the far end of the gate and what they saw made them jump from their seats. Three gunmen with machine guns aiming directly at the car.

“Duck!” Screamed Shiva as the terrorists’ showered shots over shots on the Toyota.

“We don't have a choice but to crash the car on them if we want to survive.” Tony barely heard what Shiva said, but he understood. He gave an approving nod and peeped through the once intact windscreen speeding at the three armed men. Maybe they did not expect this to happen, but the terrorist stood their ground and fired without moving an inch. The foursome braced for impact as the SUV crashed head-on with two of the terrorists and threw the other off guard hitting him in the stomach, throwing him on the road head first. The SUV then crashed into the wall surrounding the school, crushing the bodies of the two terrorists against it. The airbags deployed, reducing the impact and silence followed.

“All these channels and nothing really worth to watch these days.” grumbled Megha switching from channel to channel.

She finds herself in the news section. All of which were reporting something about the condition of a politician who suffered a stroke. She did not care as he was known to be corrupt of the corrupt. But one of the channel catches her attention and she tunes into it.

“Breaking news,” the reporter said, “Kashmir under attack. There has been confirmed reports of terrorist attacks at least eight major military camps and areas surrounding them in Kashmir.”

A footage of the army fighting against the terrorists flash on the screen as the reporter continues.

“Here is the action live from Pampore. Three terrorists have been killed and one SSB jawan lost his life. Five terrorists are said to be left, hiding inside the perimeter of a four storied building with some hostages. Which makes it difficult for the army.” She pauses for a few seconds. “Just in,” she sounds gutted as she continued, “there has been reported attacks at the military camp, the golf course and areas surrounding. Civilian casualties have been reported.”

A shocked Megha picks up her phone and dials Shiva with her trembling hands. *Not reachable.* She tries Sheetal’s number. *Not reachable.* She tries over and over again on both the numbers and gets greeted by the same response each time. Expecting the worst, she keeps the phone on her lap and covers her face with both hands.

Sheetal ran. She ran as fast as she could. The man she was running away had just killed another. She frantically searched for a place to hide. The walled compound was humongous. There were several single storied buildings scattered inside the perimeter. She turned her face around to take a glance at the attacker who just pulled out his handgun. *He is aiming. He is bloody aiming to shoot.* The adrenaline soared through her veins. She dashed for the nearest building which was about fifteen metres ahead. Sheetal felt her legs are going to give up on her any second. *Almost there.*

A single shot rang. The loud bang reverberated through the air just as she jumped through the corridor and inside the building. Before she could register what had happened, she fell to the ground writhing in pain. *I'm shot! What do I do?* She kicked her legs trying to crawl towards the other side of the room. She searched for anything to hide behind, but all she could find were some benches and desks. She turned around lying on the floor, looking for her attacker. And there he was, his silhouette emerging through the door against the dim lit night. The realisation that the inevitable end is here triggered her whole life to flash in front of her. *This is it.* The only thing that can into her mind was Shiva and her daughter, Shruthi. *Oh God! I don't want to die.*

And there it came, a loud thud... the end.
