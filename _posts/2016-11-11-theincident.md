##### The Incident
*I am dying!*
The realisation set her free. The pain subsided as her vision went pale. She knew she did not have much time, made peace with the truth.
*Serenity.*

----------


Glancing at the corner of his laptop, Siddharth realised he is going to be late. It's been a couple of weeks since they have been planning for this. The meeting has been running late because of the release this weekend. An indispensable asset for the company, he has a great rapport with his clients and colleagues, setting an example of work ethics to follow. Due to his efficiency, the management was fine with his strict eight hours policy. Besides, work was just a means of sustenance for him. His life started after work. 

"Thanks for joining at a short notice. Appreciate all your help in coming up with the solution. Have a great weekend!" He wished his counterparts on the other side of the world. It was a little past 8:15 p.m. and the weekend traffic would be at its peak. Already three missed calls on his phone. Rather than try to call back and explain, he thought it would be better to do it in person. 

Turning the volume up on the radio, he left the premises through the main exit, the days' updates pouring in. Infiltration at the border again. His grip tightened on the steering wheel. Memories of his father's last words came back to him. 

"No matter what you do in life, ensure you do something for your country and fellow human beings. That, my son, is the greatest service you can offer." 

That's the last he ever heard from him. Ever since he has been trying to fight back the memories of the days that followed. RJ started playing some classic rock and his thoughts came back.

*No, not today. Today is day to unwind.* He thought to himself. In all his haste he had forgotten to call his brother. Parking the car to a side, he dialed his brother.

"Hey, I already left office. Where are you?"

"I am on the way." came the reply.

"Alright, I'll see you there in another fifteen minutes if the traffic shows any mercy.” He continues. “Heard anything from Shiva yet? Did they reach Ladakh yet?"

"Not sure, they are supposed to reach there either tonight or tomorrow."

He hoped against hope that they return back from the trip. He dialled Shiva, but in vain.

"Damn it!" he said to himself. But rather think about it, he started singing along to the radio to lighten up the mood.
Domlur bridge was jam packed and traffic was moving very slowly towards Old Airport Road. At work, he was a proficient ASP.NET developer and was a JavaScript guy, never understood why anyone would use Linux and thought Macs are overpriced. He was fascinated with computers at a young age as he thought programming was the one thing that let him control something and he mastered it. *Akshay is gonna be so pissed.* He thought staring at the traffic ahead.

Akshay waited impatiently, considering his option to enter alone. *Siddharth being Siddharth I guess.* He thought as a customised hatchback of German make squealed to a halt next to the parking lot. *Finally!*

Scanning the queue in front of the elevator, they made a move for the staircase.

“Ah, I hate crowded bars?” Mumbled Akshay.

“Well, get used to it. Kruthi is gonna be there.” He winked at Akshay.

“Are you serious?” Reacted Akshay, appalled.

“I don't know why you act so weird,” Siddharth shakes his head, “why not make the best of it when you can?”

“I don't know either. It just that she…. she's too clingy.” Akshay looks disgusted, “you remember the drama last time?”

“So what?” Siddharth replies. “Just try to have a good time.”

“Yeah…. you're right.” Akshay agrees. “Wish I was more like you.”

“You wish.” Siddharth looks thoughtful. “By the way, something went down in Ladakh. You heard about it?”

“Landslide?” Akshay looks clueless.

“No duffer, terrorists…” Siddharth face palms, dismayed.

“Holy shit! Shiva might be there. Maybe we should call him.” Said Akshay with a mix of anxiety and restlessness evident on his face.

“I tried, but he's not reachable. Let's just hope for the best….”

“….and not tell mom.” Akshay cuts in. Siddharth shakes his head in agreement.

 Siddharth, being a regular at the place, knew his way around. As he maneuvered through the crowd, Akshay lagged behind. The rooftop bar provided exactly what is expected from it. Microbrewery with outdoor seating and a separate smoking area with the availability of the whole bar and a dance floor to go with - the place proved to be the perfect go-to for party animals. The variety of food ranging from American to Continental and Indian to Mediterranean helped further to make it the perfect place to unwind on weekends. 

“Hey Sourav, happy birthday man.” Said Siddharth stopping next to a table of seven as Akshay catches up.

“Thanks bro,” Sourav gets up, hugs Siddharth and frowns, “and thanks for being late as always.”

“Hey it is not my fault,” he pulls Akshay in front of him from behind, “this guy took his time to get off from work.”

Akshay freezes, passes a sardonic smile at Siddharth, “Yeah right!”

“Akshaaaaaayyy……….” A squeaky voice came from the other side of the table. “I'm so happy you are here. Sid never told you will be coming.”

“Yeah, now you know.” Akshay smiles disinterested as Kruthi gets up and gives him a warm hug.

She holds him by his elbow and leads him to her seat. “Chandini, scooch over. I'm sitting with Akshay.”

Akshay looked at Siddharth helplessly. He, in turn, gave Akshay a thumbs up mouthing, “Have some fun.”

"So how's work?" asked Saurav gesturing Siddharth to take a seat.

"Pretty good man,” he replied going through the menu, “we migrated the whole system from asp.net to asp.net MVC over past months and coming week is the release. Just got the UAT sign off yesterday." replied Siddharth.

"Well, good for you. People like us manage the entire project and lead developers like you take away all the credit. Buggers!" swore Saurav.

"Chill buddy, it's not like that everywhere. Probably time for you to look out for a change." Siddharth said patting Saurav.

They cut the cake and completed all the birthday formalities. Two of them went to the dance floor and the others stayed back to engage in conversation. The conversation drifted to various other from work to personal life. Meanwhile, Akshay reluctantly chatted with Kruthi loosening up little by little as time passed. *He's getting laid tonight.* Siddharth grinned. From the corner of his eyes, he saw this lady walk in and take the seat at the corner next to the bar. He fixed his gaze upon her. The black A-line linen cocktail dress accentuated her hourglass figure perfectly blending with the silky straights. *Five feet 7 probably. Just a couple shorter than me.* Siddharth thought to himself. *Maybe more suited for Akshay’s five-eleven frame.* He chuckles with a touch of sarcasm, an innate nature of his. *Who am I kidding.*

"Smitten?" asked Saurav playfully breaking Siddharth’s chain of thoughts.

"Nah, but looks like she deserves to be in the company of a handsome young man," Siddharth responded with a grin.

"Go ahead, cowboy!" Saurav encouraged.

Siddharth stood up and walked towards the end of the bar. It was not a surprise for his friends as this was not the first time and probably not the last either.

"A virgin mojito please." He mentioned to the bartender turning his gaze at the lady in black, smiling.

"Virgin mojito? Seriously?" said the girl, passing a wry smile.

"I got to drive back home tonight, I drink responsibly." Replied Siddharth in a carefree manner.

"Is that so? Interesting!" she moves closer towards him with genuine interest.

Akshay watched as Siddharth worked his magic. In just a few minutes he was able to get the attention of the lady in black. She was all flirty and did not miss a single chance to make contact  with him. *He is good. Maybe I should learn from him.* He looked at his partner for the night. *Maybe not.* Siddharth whispered something into the lady in black’s ear and they got up to leave. Siddharth came directly towards Akshay.

“Tell mom not to wait up,” he winked, “and you Sir, try to have some fun.”

He left with the lady in black as the rest of the table stared at each other, impressed. *Hel yeah,l I’m gonna have fun. He is right.* Akshay turns towards Kruthi and holds her hand gently.

“Do you wanna, uh… go somewhere.”

Her face lit up as if she won a lottery worth a million dollar. “Yes, of course, I do.”

He immediately regretted the decision.

With blocked ears and the cold setting in, Stella and Sheetal waited for Tony and Shiva with the kids sleeping on the back. A number of electric drills can be heard functioning at regular intervals west of the military camp. It sounds muffled, maybe because of their blocked ears.

“Why are they taking so long?” Stella whispered not able to hide the frustration, “it's been almost ten minutes. I'm so hungry and tired.

“I've got a bad feeling about this Stella.” Sheetal opened the window studying what lay ahead. “They went inside I guess. Maybe we should go che…..”

Before she could complete, her eyes gazed at the sight of everyone jumping over the check post and sprinting towards their respective cars with Shiva and Tony leading the front.

“What in the name of heaven are they doing?” Stella shot a questioning glance at Sheetal.
She stares at them intently without responding to Stella.

They open the doors and leap inside making a thud. “Go go go!” Shouts Shiva.

“What the hell happened?” Sheetal shouts bracing herself as Tony puts the car in reverse and guns the throttle. The tires  screech and get into motion.

“The place is under attack. We might be surrounded from all sides. There are terrorists in the Indian Air Force Base and at the back of the military area.” Shiva regrets not putting the seatbelt on as he crashes into the dashboard.

It took a few seconds to register. But once it did a sense of fear she has never felt crept into Sheetal’s body. *It was gunfire, not drills.* The sudden realisation makes her go numb. Shiva motions to put the seatbelt on just as the car comes to a halt.

“Why did you stop?” Stella cried.

“I think we got a situation, guys.” Tony looks back with an expression so grim, making the rest automatically turn behind. What they saw sent shivers through their spines.
