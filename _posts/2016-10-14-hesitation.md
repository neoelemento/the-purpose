*Present day*

Akshay reads the form for the third time and contemplates whether it is time to proceed or not. A thousand thoughts occupied his mind. He looks up at the framed photograph of his Dad hung up on the wall expecting a sign. He gets nothing. He goes through the form again and his gaze meets the words ‘Join Indian Army’ written at the top left of the website. His chain of thoughts are broken by his Mom, Megha, who enters the room.

“You want tea Akshay?” She asked as she places a plate of delicious chapatis and dal curry on the table.

“Yes please,” he answers with a big smile on his face, “how can I start the day without your tea.”

“Haha! As if I would fall for your sweet buttering.” She said, “By the way, you know when Shiva and the rest are getting back?”

“Probably will take another week,” he said taking a bite of chapati, “they will be reaching Ladhak tomorrow as far as I know.”

“Okay okay.” She said as her eyes meets the screen.

Akshay, stops chewing, realise that she got to know what he was doing. The jovial mood turns to an awkward tense one. Megha becomes extremely anxious and Akshay turns pale, not knowing how to get through the situation.

“So you have made your decision, haven’t you?” She questions holding back on her emotions.

“Mom, it’s not as you think it is. Karan told me that the forms are available online,” he turns around and shows her the website, “I'm just checking it.”

“Oh, you're just checking,” she cuts in passive aggressively, “so the form just filled on its own?”

“I just wanted to see Mom, I swear! In case if I ever wanted to apply…”

Before he could complete the sentence, she cuts him off, “…If you ever wanted to apply?” She takes a deep breath, trying to calm herself down. “I see, that is really nice Akshay….” 

She pauses for a second and sobs, “I lost my husband and I'm not ready lose my son too.”

“Mom seriously. There's nothing to worry about”

“Why can't you be like Siddharth? He's my son too. But he chose a career which does not risk lives.” She wipes off the tears using the pallu of her saree.

“Okay mom. I will not apply.” He closes the window and deletes the form assuring her. “You don't have to worry about it anymore.”
He gets up and hugs her. She cries harder. “I don't want to lose you beta. I don't ever want to lose you.

*Mini Terrace, Snow Valley Resorts*

Shiva takes another sip of coffee letting the caffeine do its job. As opposed to the website, the place exceeded their expectations and he felt glad Tony and Stella convinced them to do this. The mini terrace is usually packed during the evenings making it a great place to chill in the mornings; without any interruptions other than the occasional waiters.

“It does feel great to take some time off.” He began, prompting Sheetal to look up from her phone. “We should do this more often.”

He points at at the splendid view of the mountains. Sheetal turns and smiles, enjoying the scenic beauty as Tony and Stella take orders from the counter on the far end.

“Yeah, look at us having fun. I'm happy you finally admit this to be a good idea.” She said pointing to her phone. “Look, if we start by morning, tomorrow, it will take us about fourteen hours to reach Leh-Ladakh.”

He picks the phone from her and looks intently as Tony and Stella join them at the table with toasts and sandwiches.

“I have never seen you concentrate on something so much since Manju’s birthday party.” Said Tony with a chuckle he peeked to take a look into Sheetal’s phone. “Show me what you looking at.”

“Can you really blame me? She had the most delicious birthday cake ever!” Said Shiva frowning at Tony. He focuses back on the phone. “See, it will take us fourteen hours to get from here to Ladakh. If we start tomorrow morning, it will be really late when we get there.”

“So what do you suggest?” Asked Tony as everyone's attention turns to Shiva.

“We have two options,” Shiva looks up and continues, “we can either make a stop at Pang or Debring tomorrow and continue to Ladakh the day after. Or we have to take the risk and go all the way.”

“It will cut short our stay at Ladakh to just a day if we don't get there tomorrow.” Stella interjected.

“The whole place will be snowy and a little too risky to drive at night, don't you think?” Counters Sheetal.

“Come on you guys. We are here for an adventure and that might be it!” Tony gets up and points North.

“What if something goes…”

“Nothing will go wrong brother,” Tony cuts him short, “Trust me. We'll all be fine.” Tony raises his glass for a toast.

“Yeah, what the hell.” Sheetal raises her glass too just after Stella does.

“Come on Shiva, join the party. Don't make us wait.” Said an excited Tony.

“Okay… I won't spoil it for you.” Shiva raises his glass hesitantly, not realising this decision will come to haunt him in 36 hours.

##### Delhi (NCR)

*Danport International Bank*

Jay found it really hard to breathe running through the service road, almost getting hit by a Honda sedan while crossing the intersection next to his office building. He checked his phone and heaved a sigh of relief realising he still got a couple of minutes to make it on time. *What a great time for the car to break down! Unreliable piece of shit.* He cursed as he entered.

He walked briskly through the path between the staff cabins ignoring their presence and went straight to his. Compared to the rest, his cabin was totally different in an expensive way. Well, he is the Director. Isn't it expected from him. He did always feel a station higher than everyone every time he stepped into his cabin. It was a 20X15 room, fully furnished with wall to wall carpeting, a big size teak table with intricate artworks on both sides and an executive chair to go with it. A couch on the side next to the door, a two tonne air conditioner and a 42 inch television. He felt the same this time but the frustration was evident when he realised he forgot to switch the television off the day before.

“Pakistan defence minister threatens India with nuclear attack,” said the reporter, “if the defence and survival is in danger they would use everything to protect themselves is what he said.”

The shot changes to the video of defence minister in a press conference. A visible pissed Jay takes the remote controller and slams hard on the button with his thumb switching the television off.

“They'll nuke us it seems. Come you bloody bastards, you won't survive if you do.” He throws the remote on the couch.

He picks up the office phone and dials. The call connects after a few rings.

“Hey Vrinda, I have reached.” Said Jay cheerfully, hiding the frustration.

“Hi honey, you never call to let me know you reached. Why today?” Asked a confused Vrinda.

“You know me so well,” Jay laughs, “my car broke down, can you ask Shambhu to call me?”

“What happened? Is everything okay?” Vrinda panics.

“Yeah yeah, just an issue with the battery.” Said he sitting on one of the sides of the table. “Shambhu can collect the keys and get it fixed by evening.”

“Okay okay, I'll tell him to call you.” Vrinda says feeling better.

“Say ‘Hi’ to the kids. Got a meeting. Gotta go.” Jay hangs up before Vrinda could respond.

About a thousand kilometres away, Akshay restores the form from the recycle bin. He opens it and stares at it. *It is now or never.* He attaches it to the website and proceeds to click on submit for the second time this morning. He hesitates. *Oh God! Help me…*
