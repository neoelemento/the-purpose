*Present day*

Akshay reads the form for the third time and contemplates whether it is time to proceed or not. A thousand thoughts occupy his mind. He looks up at the framed photograph of his Dad hung up on the wall expecting a sign. He gets nothing. He reads through the form again and his gaze meets the words ‘Join Indian Army’ written at the top left of the website. His chain of thoughts are broken by his Mom, Megha, who enters the room.

“You want tea Akshay?” She asked as she place a plate of delicious chapatis and dal curry on the table.

“Yes please,” he answers with a big smile on his face, “how can I start the day without your tea.”

“Haha! I won't fall for your buttering beta.” She said smiling, “By the way, you know when Shiva and the rest are coming back?”

“Probably will take another week,” he said taking a bite of chapati, “they will be reaching Ladhak tomorrow as far as I know.”

“Okay okay.” She said as her eyes meets the screen.

Akshay stops, another bite halfway to his mouth, realising she found out what he was doing. The jovial mood turns to an awkward tense one. Megha becomes extremely anxious as Akshay turns pale, not knowing how to get through the situation.

“So you have made your decision, haven’t you?” She questions trying to hide her disappointment.

“Mom, it’s not what you think it is. Karan told me the forms are available online,” he turns around and shows her the website, “I'm just checking.”

“Oh, you're just checking,” she cuts in, pointing at the form, “so the form filled on its own?”

“I just wanted to see Mom, I swear! In case if I ever wanted to apply…”

Before he could complete the sentence, she breaks into tears, “If you ever wanted to apply?” She takes a deep breath, trying to calm herself. “I see, that is really nice Akshay...” 

She pauses for a second, “I lost my husband and I'm not ready lose my son too.”

“Mom seriously. There's nothing to worry about”

“Why can't you be like Siddharth? He's my son too. But he chose a career which does not risk lives.” She wipes off the tears using the pallu of her saree.

“Okay mom. I will not apply.” He closes the window and deletes the form trying to assure her. “You don't have to worry about it anymore.”

He gets up and hugs her. She cries harder. “I don't want to lose you beta. I don't ever want to lose you.

*Mini Terrace, Snow Valley Resorts*

Shiva takes another sip of coffee letting the caffeine do its job. Cool morning breeze and the sound of birds worked out to be a well deserved change from the busy and polluted city. As opposed to the website, the place exceeded their expectations and he felt glad Tony and Stella convinced them to do this. The mini terrace is usually packed during the evenings making it a great place to chill in the morning; without any interruptions other than the occasional waiters.

“It does feel great to take some time off.” He began, prompting Sheetal to look up from her phone. “We should do this more often.”

He points at the splendid view of the mountains. Sheetal turns and smiles, enjoying the scenic beauty as Tony and Stella take orders from the counter on the far end.

“Yeah, look at us having fun. I'm happy you finally admit this to be a good idea.” She said pointing to her phone. “Look, if we start by morning tomorrow, it will take us about fourteen hours to reach Leh-Ladakh.”

He takes the phone from her and looks intently as Tony and Stella join them at the table with toasts and sandwiches.

“I have never seen you concentrate on something so much since Manju’s birthday party.” Said Tony with a chuckle as he peeked to take a look at Sheetal’s phone. “Show me what you looking at.” They foursome share a laughs

“Can you really blame me? She had the most delicious birthday cake ever!” Said Shiva frowning at Tony. He focuses back on the phone. “See, it will take us fourteen hours to get from here to Ladakh. If we start early tomorrow, it will be very late when we get there.”

“So what do you suggest?” Asked Tony as everyone's attention turns to Shiva.

“We have two options,” Shiva looks up and continues, “we can either make a stop at Pang or Debring tomorrow and continue to Ladakh the day after. Or we have to take the risk and go all the way.”

“If we don't get there tomorrow, it will cut short our stay at Ladakh to just a day.” Stella interjected.

“The whole place will be snowy and a little too risky to drive at night, don't you think?” Counters Sheetal.

“Come on you guys. We are here for some adventure,"  Tony gets up and points North, "and that might be it!”

“What if something goes…”

“Nothing will go wrong brother,” Tony cuts him short, “Trust me. We'll all be fine.” Tony raises his glass for a toast.

“Yeah, what the hell.” Sheetal raises her glass too just after Stella does.

“Come on Shiva, join the party. Don't make us wait.” Said an excited Tony.

“Okay… I won't spoil it for you.” Shiva raises his glass hesitantly, not realising this decision will come to haunt him in 36 hours.

##### Delhi (NCR)

*Danport International*

Jay found it really hard to breathe running through the service road, almost getting hit by a Honda sedan while crossing the intersection next to his office building. He checked his phone and heaved a sigh of relief realising he still has a couple of minutes to make it on time. 

*What a great time for the car to break down! Unreliable piece of shit.* He cursed as he entered. He walked briskly through the path between the staff cabins ignoring their presence and went straight to his. Compared to the rest, his cabin was totally different in an expensive way. Well, he is the Director. He did always feel a station higher than everyone every time he stepped into his cabin.  Isn't it expected from him. His cabin is a 20X15 room, fully furnished with wall to wall carpeting, a big size teak table with intricate artworks on both sides and an executive chair to go with it. A couch on the side next to the door, a two tonne air conditioner and a 42 inch television. He felt the same this time but the frustration was evident when he realised he forgot to switch the television off the day before.

“Pakistan defence minister threatens India with nuclear attack,” said the reporter from the news channel that was playing, “if the defence and survival is in danger they would use everything to protect themselves, is what he said.”

The shot changes to the video of defence minister giving a press conference. A visibly pissed Jay takes the remote controller and slams hard on the button with his thumb switching the television off.

“They'll nuke us it seems. Come you bloody bastards, you won't survive if you do.” He throws the remote on the couch.

He picks up the office phone and dials. The call connects after a few rings.

“Hey Vrinda, I have reached.” Said Jay cheerfully, hiding the frustration.

“Hi honey, you never call to let me know you reached.” Asked a confused Vrinda. "Why today?"

“You know me so well,” Jay laughs, “my car broke down, can you ask Shambhu to call me?”

“What happened? Is everything okay?” Vrinda sounds worried.

“Yeah yeah, just an issue with the battery.” Said he sitting on one of the sides of the table. “Shambhu can collect the keys and get it fixed by evening.”

“Okay okay, I'll tell him to call you.” Vrinda responds.

“Say ‘Hi’ to the kids. Got a meeting. Gotta go.” Jay hangs up before Vrinda could respond.

Over two thousand kilometres south, Akshay restores the form from the recycle bin. He opens it and stares at it. *It is now or never.* He attaches it to the website and proceeds to click on submit for the second time this morning. He hesitates. *Oh God! Help me…*
