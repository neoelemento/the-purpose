Shiva reached for his watch. He had the habit of wearing it on his right wrist. It was fifteen past 8 at night. They have been on road for over thirteen hours making just two stops of half an hour each to refresh and snack. The Toyota Fortuner 3.0 AT 4X4 cruised through Hemis in between the silhouettes of mountains overlapping each other on both sides as he realised their destination is a positive forty-five minutes further.

They had split driving time to three and a half hours each; with Stella and Sheetal taking the morning hours, Shiva and Tony taking the rest respectively. Shiva was glad not to be in the driver seat for the last session of the journey and also the purchase of Fortuner over Mahindra XUV 500. The four-cylinder engine proved to be the beast suited for these conditions. Even though the road have been treacherous, his SUV managed to pass it with great ease. Stella and Sheetal are resting in the back. The altitude sickness really got to everyone, but the desire for adventure kept them going. *Good we left the kids with Tony’s parents.* He believed he got the best slot of the four. He did really enjoy the scenery throughout the morning and now he gets to take some rest. Tony was doing a commendable job manoeuvring the vehicle through the uneven terrain with ease. We are in safe hands. Shiva leaned back and reflected. *This proved to be a great idea.* Only last week he was stressing himself out about the failed tender on the Silver Skies apartment deal. He felt his whole career hung by a thread. But here he is now, feeling stupid for taking so much of pressure. *It's just a job.* He chuckled as he drifted away.

The 470 plus kilometres journey from Manali to Leh-Ladakh is nothing short of an adventure. The first major spectacle to encounter is the Rohtang Pass. At around 12,750 feet above sea level, the Rohtang Pass gives an idea of what to expect on the way. Jispa comes about ninety kilometres in. It is a beautiful picturesque landscape located near the river Chandra. Being 10,000 feet high, it provides a panoramic view of the surrounding valley. The Zingzing Bar, thirty kilometres from Jispa, is one of the highest roadside bars in the world. It is a resting ground frequented by army cadets and tourists alike. The Baralacha La Pass located in the high altitude sections of the Zanskar region is the confluence point of many roads. Standing tall at 16,000 feet, it divides Bhaga and Yunam rivers. It is the starting point of Suraj Tal Trek.

Halfway through, the path crosses Sarchu, locally known as ‘Sir Bhum Chum’. It is the perfect place for overnight stay and camping. Overlooking majestic mountains at 14,300 feet, the view is inexplicably surreal. With twenty-one winding curves and hairpins, the Gata loops (17,000 feet) is what follows. It is the place which can prove to be a nightmare for even the best of the best drivers on any given day. The only relatively easy route in the journey comes at Lachulung La. At 16,000 feet, the entire Ladakh plateau can be seen from here. The picture it paints is something worth a lifetime. A little less than ten hours into the journey is the location of Pang, the traditional army stop which is now a major spot for tourists as well. It is considered to be the highest army transit camp in the world. Tanglang La Pass (17,500 feet) is the second highest motor-able Pass in the planet. Traversing Tanglang La feels like ascending to the clouds as if it is the stairway to heaven. The Tso Kar Lake can be witnessed behind the gigantic mountains providing a picture of God’s watercolour painting on the canvas called earth. And just about forty kilometres from Ladakh is Hemis, which is known for the Hemis National Park and Monastery.

Shiva felt disoriented when he woke up. His ears were blocked and breathing laboured. Tony was saying something to him but he could not hear him clearly. *How long have I been sleeping?* He reached out for his wrist watch - Rolex Yacht-Master II. A gift from a powerful client for closing a high-profile deal. Five past nine. *We must have reached.* He shook himself out of the slumber.

“It seems there is something wrong Shiva. We are a few minutes away from Golf course..” Said Tony pointing forward at the makeshift checkpost next to the military area. “They are not letting anyone through.”

A couple of the passengers from the few vehicles in front is seen to be talking to the officers guarding the checkpost.

“Maybe a routine checking,” Shiva unbuckled the seatbelt, “taking too long. Let's go check.”

Sheetal and Stella get up from the slumber. “Did we reach?” Stella questions inspecting the surrounding. “Doesn't look like it…”

“The army has set up a checkpost and they are now letting anyone through.” Said Tony.

“Why? What happens?” Sheetal looks puzzled.

“Don't know Sheetal,” Shiva opens the door and proceeds to get off, “let us go check Tony.”

“Okay…” said Tony as he did the same.
